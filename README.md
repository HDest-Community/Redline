### Important
- This mod requires [AceCoreLib](https://gitlab.com/accensi/hd-addons/acecorelib).

### Notes
---
- The loadout code is `rdl`.
- Configuration codes are:
	- `scope`: Self-explanatory.
	- `sink`: Heat sink for faster heat dissipation
	- `cap`: Capacitor for landing an extra shot.
	- `resonator`: Replaces the internal engine with a simpler resonator. (In other words, brings back the old Redline.)

### Mechanics
---
- Firing the weapon generates heat and RPM. If you get enough heat, the gun will overheat and will become unusable until the heat dissipates. More damage means more heat.
- Pulling the bolt and holding it will rev up the engine. The more RPM, the more damage that is stored in the charge. The damage boost is tier-based. Each notch on the RPM meter increases the tier once it's reached.
- If the resonator is used, only the heat mechanic applies since there is no engine.
