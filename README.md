### Important
- This mod requires [AceCoreLib](https://gitlab.com/accensi/hd-addons/acecorelib).

### Notes
---
- The loadout code is `rdl`.
- Configuration codes are:
	- `scope`: Self-explanatory.
	- `sink`: Heat sink for faster heat dissipation

### Mechanics
---
- Firing the weapon generates heat. If you get enough heat, the gun will overheat and will become unusable until the heat dissipates.
- Pulling the bolt and holding it will rev up the engine. The more RPM, the more damage, but also the more heat generated. If you redline the engine, you can do extra more damage at the cost of even more heat per shot.
- Shifting gears increases the heat generated from each shot, but also increase the max range of the damage you can deal.
- If you are trying to rev the engine but the RPM still goes down or doesn't move, shift down a gear or two.
